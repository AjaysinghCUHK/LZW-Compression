# LZW-Compression
The LZW algorithm is based on the LZ77 algorithm, which is proposed by A. Lempel and J. Ziv in 1977. Like LZ77 and LZ78, LZW is a dictionary based compression algorithm and does not perform any analysis on the input text. LZW is widely known for its application in GIF and in the V.42 communication standard.
